Todo
-------------
* [FIXED] Caching system. Also including a GuavaCachingStrategy
* Repository for controllers? Or at least specify package names to look in.
* [FIXED] Specify where Jangular should look for template files
* Tests & Documentation
* [FIXED] Maybe compile() shouldn't return a node, but rather an object that holds both the node and the CompilerSession
* [FIXED] Translations. Can be implemented as directives / inline-directives 
* [FIXED] Will the generated classes ever disappear or will we eat memory until we die? 
* Directives as attributes and some transclude functionality?
