Jangular
========

Java Templating engine with AngularJS-like syntax and concepts


Todo
-------------
* Cache
* Repository for controllers? Or at least specify package names to look in.
* Specify where Jangular should look for template files
* Tests & Documentation
* Maybe compile() shouldn't return a node, but rather an object that holds both the node and the CompilerSession
* Translations?
* [FIXED] ill the generated classes ever disappear or will we eat memory until we die? 
* Directives as attributes and some transclude functionality?
